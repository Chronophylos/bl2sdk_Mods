#Setup
1. Download: [Pawn Grenade](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/234)  
2. Add the ``Pokelands.blcm`` to the ``PawnGrenade.blcm`` using BLCMM and let it overwrite anything it wants.  
2b. Tick the ``Offline`` box in BLCMM to change the Hotfix method. For me the normal online one didn't work when tested.  
2c. Save the changes, you may now close BLCMM.
3. Add the ``Nasty Suprise`` to your characters inventory, preferably with a low fuse.
4. In Game, first ``exec PawnGrenade.blcm``, then enable the Pokelands SDK mod.
5. Thats it.
